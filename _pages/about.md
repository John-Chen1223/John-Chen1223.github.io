I am now pursuing my M.S. degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/), enrolled in Sept 2022, attending Provincial Key Laboratory of Aerospace Communication and Networking Technology, supervised by Prof. [Shaohua Wu](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/wushaohua) and Prof. [Qinyu Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangqinyu). My major is Information and Communication Engineering. Before that, I also graduated with a B.S. Degree in Communication Engineering from this university and was awarded postgraduate guaranteed admission.

I am interested in wireless communications and networking, space communications, resource allocation and optimisation, and intelligent communications.
