**Abstract**: Deep space communication systems play a key role in human endeavors for lunar basing, Mars, and further cosmic exploration. In pursuit of establishing the Moon as a deep space Internet portal for future human exploration, a lunar communication and navigation integrated (CNI) satellite constellation design is intended into consideration. Based on Fibonacci lattice virtual observation point model, featuring better uniformity and stochasticity, we derive objectives related to access coverage, power, quadruple coverage, and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), together with multiple multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) combined with Earth-Moon difference analysis to explore better utilization of overall resources in the lunar integrated constellation. The pareto model, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the construction of the constellation system are incorporated into the solution to pursue a higher guiding value. In particular, inspired by the lunar frozen orbit (LFO), the hybrid inclination (HyInc) Walker configuration is proposed with theoretical validation and simulation evaluation, showing some superiority over traditional Walker and remains generalizable. Extensive simulation and comprehensive analysis are performed, including the pareto-optimal integrated constellations and the revelation of HyInc Walkerâ€™s coverage equalization capability, with the latter being less studied. The entire constellation design process of this work is highly migratory and the proposed perspective of the configuration is enlightening.
